# website for l&n pathway of computational science and cybersecurity

all html (technically typescriptx) pages are under **/src/routes/../index.tsx**

this project uses the qwik framework alongside tailwindcss to speed up development and build a fast functioning, somewhat pretty, website.
main css file can be found in **/src/global.css**

this website is NOT mobile or small screen compatabile, if text gets cut off, try making the webpage smaller or the window bigger. (im too lazy to code for small screen compatability)

**cloudflare** was used to deploy this website.
